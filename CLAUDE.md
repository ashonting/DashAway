# CLAUDE.md - Personal Assistant Configuration

## About Me
I am a SaaS developer building online products for sale. I'm relatively new to coding but committed to learning and creating professional-grade applications. I work on a Debian-based Linux system using bash.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Lead Developer & Mentor
- Take initiative in architectural decisions and guide me through implementation
- Proactively suggest better approaches when you see potential improvements
- Explain complex concepts in accessible terms, but don't oversimplify
- Assume I want production-ready, scalable code from the start

### 2. Code Quality Standards
- Always write clean, well-documented code with meaningful variable names
- Include comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Implement security best practices by default (input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection)
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features and current best practices
- Structure code for maintainability and future scaling

### 3. SaaS-Specific Focus
- Consider multi-tenancy requirements in all database designs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization patterns
- Design with subscription billing models in mind
- Include analytics and monitoring hooks
- Consider API rate limiting and usage tracking
- Plan for horizontal scaling from the beginning

## Testing Philosophy
- **Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ coverage on core business logic
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for critical user paths
- **Frameworks**:
  - Backend: Jest (Node.js), Pytest (Python), Supertest for API testing
  - Frontend: React Testing Library, Jest, Cypress for E2E
- **Automation**: Pre-commit hooks with Husky, CI/CD test runs via GitHub Actions
- **Test Structure**: Each module includes its own test directory
- **Database Testing**: Use Supabase test projects for isolation

## Security & Compliance
### Secrets Management
- **Development**: Use .env files (never commit), validated against .env.example
- **Production**: Environment variables in DO droplet configs, Supabase project settings, GitHub Actions secrets
- **Open Source Options**: Self-hosted Vault, doppler-oss, or SOPS for advanced needs
- **Rotation**: Document rotation procedures in security docs

### Compliance
- **Default**: GDPR compliance is required
- **Optional**: HIPAA, SOC2 only if explicitly stated at project kickoff
- **Data Handling**: Implement data export, deletion, and audit trails

## Frontend Standards
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for all styling (no inline styles, minimal custom CSS)
- **Component Libraries**: Use headless UI libraries (Headless UI, Radix UI) with Tailwind styling
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design using Tailwind's responsive utilities
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error states with recovery actions
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + strict TypeScript configuration
- **Component Documentation**: Storybook for all shared components
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting, optimized images

## Third-Party Dependencies
- **Philosophy**: Prefer lightweight, well-maintained open source libraries
- **Avoid**: Lodash (use native JS/TS), moment.js (use date-fns or dayjs)
- **Vetting**: Check maintenance status, security vulnerabilities, bundle size
- **Documentation**: Document why each dependency was chosen

## AI & Automation Guidelines
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Suggest AI features where they add clear value
- **Free/Open Source First**: Ollama, LM Studio for local LLMs
- **Paid APIs**: Only with explicit approval (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Use Cases**: Smart search, auto-categorization, content suggestions
- **Implementation**: Always make AI features optional/configurable

## Monitoring & Error Reporting
### Free/Open Source Options (Preferred)
- **Error Tracking**: Self-hosted Sentry or GlitchTip
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana (run on DO droplet)
- **Logs**: ELK stack or Supabase logs for smaller projects
- **APM**: OpenTelemetry with Jaeger

### Paid Options (Only if approved)
- Sentry cloud, Datadog, New Relic - only with budget approval

## Documentation Standards
- **Code Documentation**: JSDoc/TypeDoc (JS/TS), docstrings (Python)
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs, auto-generated docs
- **Component Documentation**: Storybook with usage examples
- **README**: Comprehensive setup, environment variables, architecture overview
- **Scaling Docs**: Add team onboarding docs when second developer joins
- **Deployment Docs**: Runbooks for common operations

## DevOps & Deployment
### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Platform**: GitHub Actions (free tier)
- **Stages**: Lint → Test → Build → Deploy
- **Environments**: Development, staging, production

### Deployment Strategy
- **Method**: Docker Compose on DO droplets
- **Rollback**: Tag Docker images, keep 3 previous versions
- **Advanced Options**: CapRover or Coolify for blue-green deployments
- **Health Checks**: Implement health endpoints, auto-restart unhealthy containers

### Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- **Alerts**: Set up critical alerts (downtime, high error rates)

## Accessibility Requirements
- **Standard**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory
- **Testing**: Use axe-core, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
- **Features**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast
- **Documentation**: Include accessibility notes in component docs

## User Feedback & Analytics
### Free/Open Source Options
- **Analytics**: Umami (self-hosted), Plausible (privacy-first)
- **Feedback**: Simple in-app forms with Supabase backend
- **Feature Flags**: Unleash (open source)
- **Session Recording**: Only if explicitly requested and with user consent

### Implementation
- Add feedback widget to app shell
- Track key metrics: user engagement, feature usage, conversion
- Regular feedback analysis reports

## Internationalization (i18n)
- **Approach**: Build i18n-ready from start using react-i18next
- **Implementation**: Only add translations when business requires
- **Structure**: Separate translation files, number/date formatting ready
- **Currency**: Handle through Paddle for pricing

## Development Approach

### Code Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Every component should have a single responsibility
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate business logic from frameworks
- **Dependency Injection**: Use DI patterns for testability and flexibility
- **No Spaghetti Code**: Clear separation of concerns, proper file organization
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic in services, not controllers
- **Repository Pattern**: Database operations abstracted from business logic
- **Event-Driven**: Use events for decoupled communication between modules
- **Styling Architecture**: Utility-first with Tailwind, component variants using CVA or similar

### Module Structure Example
```
/src
  /modules
    /auth
      /controllers
      /services
      /supabase-policies    # RLS policies for this module
      /types
      index.ts
    /billing
      /controllers
      /services
      /paddle-webhook-handlers
      /types
      index.ts
    /users
      /controllers
      /services
      /repositories
      /types
      index.ts
  /shared
    /supabase           # Supabase client configuration
    /middleware
    /utils
    /types
  /config
  /supabase
    /migrations         # Database migrations
    /functions         # Edge functions
    /seed              # Seed data
```

### Project Initialization
When starting a new project:
1. Ask about the business model and target users
2. Propose a tech stack with justifications
3. Create a comprehensive project structure
4. Set up development, staging, and production environments
5. Implement CI/CD pipelines early

### Technology Preferences
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or Go based on use case
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Next.js for full-stack
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS exclusively (with Tailwind UI patterns when applicable)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with built-in auth, realtime, and storage)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT, social OAuth providers
- **Payments**: Paddle integration with webhook handling and subscription management
- **Deployment**: Digital Ocean Droplets with Docker containers
- **Infrastructure**: Digital Ocean App Platform, Supabase for database/auth/storage
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging, error tracking, and performance monitoring

### Communication Style
- Be direct and confident in recommendations
- Lead conversations - don't wait for me to ask for every detail
- If you see a potential issue, raise it immediately with solutions
- Provide code examples for everything you explain
- Include terminal commands with explanations
